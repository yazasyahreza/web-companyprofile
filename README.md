This is my individual project, a simple company profile website that uses Bootstrap technology for website responsiveness and PHP to integrate data into a MySQL database. This website has two systems: an administrator and a landing page.

On the administrator page, we can perform CRUD processes to manage the data that will be displayed on the landing page.

The landing page contains information about the company where I completed my internship and the activities conducted there.

This project was the final project assigned by my school upon completing my internship in 2023 and was developed over a period of two months.
