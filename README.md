This project is a company profile website developed as an individual assignment using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. The system is divided into two modules:

- Administrator Panel: Enables CRUD operations for managing company data dynamically.

- Landing Page: Displays company information and documentation of internship activities.

Developed over the course of two months, this project was my final internship project in 2023, emphasizing responsive web design, structured database management, and clean user interface implementation.
